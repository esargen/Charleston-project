            <p>The address for the community center is 810 Meeting Street, selected to be an “anchor” for the existing community in the face of massive housing development projects in the area that threaten it. The site is tucked between state highway 52 and i26, making noise pollution a concern.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The site has some notable neighbors. The International Longshoremen's Association Building is right next door, as well as the Charleston City Recreation Services, making this a very local-friendly corner of the city. Restaurants in the area range from the hyperlocal (see: Martha Lou’s Kitchen, a tiny Southern restaurant classified as "historic") to the very new (see: Butcher + Bee, a hip eatery with a glossy website that boasts locations in both Charleston and Nashville). The establishment immediately adjacent to the site, the Tattooed Moose, is called a local staple in some literature online (despite also being a permanent fixture in various tourist guides). A few churches and religious buildings are scattered around the neighborhood, and a large graveyard stretches behind the International Longshoremen's Association.

            <p>I think it would be interesting to play off the idea of a playground with this project, possibly involving having partitioned spaces for "adult playgrounds" and standard ones that are visually cohesive but contrast in the method of "play" (e.g. the adult playground may be less strenuous, more of a seating area)./p>

            <p>I recall hearing a podcast about the lifelong project of Japanese sculptor Noguchi to create a playground called "Play Mountain."</p>
            <p class="quote">"Play Mountain was conceived as a way of building on a city block in New York a mountain, which would, in fact, be an enhanced area for children’s play. There were steps of all sizes, a slide with water in the summer, a longer one for sledding in winter. These sloping surfaces could also serve as a roof."</p>
            <p>Borrowing elements from abstract playsites could lend both an aesthetic and programmatic advantage. I also think there's room for experimentation in Noguchi's ideas surrounding forms that act as both mound, roof and enclosure.</p>

            <p>Primarily, I want to focus on the concrete blocks I saw by the dock while I was there, because I think that their function to prevent erosion relates to the underlying motivation of this project-- to prevent the erosion of local culture. The concrete blocks are called <b>articulated concrete blocks</b>.</p>

            <h1>04.03.20</h1>
            <p>Today was spent primarily thinking through the plans I made yesterday following the advice from my professor towards something a little more workable. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The concept of having the furniture on the patio be lightweight so it can be easily modified by visitors would probably work better than my idea of installing bench swings, because visitors historically value personalization over most anything else.</li>
              <li>I should work to incorporate more flexibility into the space, rather than having the classrooms be so siloed, since it would probably make more sense to have mixed use space than to mince the programming into a hallway of enclosed areas.</li>
              <li>More generally, the underlying emphasis on artistic space present in my current favorite plan could be broadened to essentially make the whole building a mixed arts space. A performance/event space could become a public <i>atelier</i>, and all the classes are for arts.</li>
              <li>There should be a large community information wall, like a corkboard, although I think I should incorporate a digital screen so that groups have the option of using digital advertising methods (and for a cool visual). This could free up a lot of space in the "welcome area" that I wasn't sure how to deal with.</li>
              <li>The patio could be pushed out onto the "nonbuildable" site a little to free up more room for art space/microstudios.</li>
              <li>Speaking of which, the microstudios are great! The line between public and private may need to be handled in a creative way. Pr. Brown used the example of the colonnades in Bernini's "Piazzo de San Pietro."</li>
                <li>An idea I proposed, which may just be the solution I use, is to elevate the studios just a meter or so.</li>

            <h1>4.05.20</h1>
            <p>Today, I revised my plan in earnest based on the feedback I listed in the last update. I am very comfortable with the place the plan is at right now, and so I'd like to spend the next few days focusing on the interior experience.</p>
            <p>In the last project, I did not consider the interior walls until it was too late to expend the amount of time I wanted to on those decisions. That is why I'd like to make a point tomorrow of taking 1-2 hours to create (optimistically) 100 quick interior sketches.</p>
            <p>As it stands,  I can already see some very interesting moments developing in this plan where there is potential for a great interior experiential shot. A few of these spots are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The border between the shaded and unshaded area on the patio.</li>
              <li>Looking through the rentable individual galleries (the partitions are all transparent with blinds to facilitate a collaborative atmosphere).</li>
              <li>The view looking into the patio from the exterior landscaping, particularly with the rounded wall.</li>
              <li>Looking down the hallway of open floor plan classrooms.</li>
              <li>The community message board in the front lobby, which I plan on having both digital and physical space to promote clubs and events.</li>

            <p>I created some very rough but considerably more detailed elevations from the prior thumbnails next to my most recent plan.</p>
            <p>For the roof, I enjoy the idea of a very dark planar roof. I will need to look into potential materials for this. On the south elevation, I particularly like the potential for a unique polygonal concrete wall that fits snugly into the roof piece, making the edge of the roof look like a thin border.</p>

            <p>Today was mostly spent on developing a site plan in Autocad based off of my hand drafted attempts.

I'm not sure if my roof solution thus far makes a lot of sense, but I like how it looks-- particularly the curvilinear cutout where the exposed portion of the patio is.</p>

            <p>During class we received feedback through three different breakout groups. Most of my feedback concerned materiality</p>
            <p>I was recommended:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To continue with having a more sparing exterior. At least one person said that she actually thought the facade plans were plenty interesting. I do enjoy the way that the roof becomes linework-like on the south facade, although I think I will continue to tweak moving forward.</li>
              <li>To look into clamshell/tabby concrete if I want to introduce texture into the facade work (this is a common concrete type in the area). I'm not sure how I feel about that texture playing against the texture of articulated concrete blocks, though.</li>
              <li>To continue with the design having one story. My second group reached a consensus that this made the building more approachable seeming as a community center.</li>
              <li>To consider incorporated subtle curvilinear elements into the facade to make it more cohesive (not altering the form of the facade to maintain contrast). Lacey Scott specifically suggested curving the shape of the windows, but my mind jumped to the idea of pouring the concrete in a way that references the silhouette of the enclosed patio.<li>

          <p>For the mid-project assessment grades, I'll be assessing based on effort, quality of concept, and quality of deliverables thus far.</p>
          <br>
            <h4 style="margin-left:0px;">Effort</h4>
            <h1 style="margin-left:100px;">B-</h1>
              <p>I'm giving myself a B because, while I feel I'm making myself work more in my sketchbook and think through this one, and I have a lot more confidence in my concept, I find myself very reluctant to put in the effort to make the digital deliverables. I find it faster and more enjoyable to sketch out designs, but I found through making one autocad draft of the floor plan that I need to be in dialogue with the official site dimensions and photos, because there is a slight disconnect.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-left:0px;">Quality of Concept</h4>
            <h1 style="margin-left:100px;">A-</h1>
              <p>I like this concept more than the last one. I feel it will fit better into the area, and that it's already far better thought out now than my last project was on the day of pin-up (should I say that?). There are still some tweakable areas, like in how the patio meets the rest of the building and how the facades relate to the context, and so I'm glad we're only halfway through.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-left:0px;">Quality of Deliverables</h4>
            <h1 style="margin-left:100px;">C+</h1>
              <p>No matter how I slice it, all I've been doing is drawing (except for the one floor plan). I'll make a day out of trying to manage a Rhino model-- my computer is just nearing the end of its life, and so a program like that takes 3 times the time it probably takes another computer. I also need to start iterating my elevations in autocad- because they're so orthogonal and simple, iterations might even be easier on that platform than in my sketchbook. I think a physical model is in order as well, however that ends up happening. My drawings are fine and I hope descriptive enough, but even they would benefit from a little more effort.</p>
